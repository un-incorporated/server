//! `/health` endpoints on the proxy.
//!
//! Three routes, split by information sensitivity:
//!
//! - `GET /health` — **open**, returns `200` with `{"status":"ok"}` plus an
//!   `observer` block when the deployment has one configured. The observer
//!   block carries the result of an active probe of the observer's
//!   `/observer/chain/deployment/head` endpoint (run inside the VPC so the
//!   mothership, which can't reach the private-subnet observer directly,
//!   still gets a real reachability signal). Probe results are cached
//!   for 15 s so LB polls don't amplify into observer load. The endpoint
//!   always returns 200 — a broken observer surfaces as
//!   `{"observer": {"reachable": false, "error": "..."}}` in the body,
//!   not as a non-200 status (keeps the LB contract stable).
//!
//! - `GET /health/ready` — **open**, returns `200 {"status":"ready"}` if
//!   the process can serve traffic (NATS connected, recent publish ok), or
//!   `503 {"status":"not_ready"}` otherwise. Used by GCP LB readiness
//!   probes. Body is minimal — no state leak.
//!
//! - `GET /health/detailed` — **JWT-gated** (audience `health-detailed`),
//!   returns the full rich body: NATS publish timestamps, per-listener pool
//!   utilization, uptime, rollup status. This is the endpoint operators
//!   poll from a control-plane UI. A scanner without the JWT secret
//!   can't fingerprint the deployment or measure saturation remotely.
//!
//! See ARCHITECTURE.md §"Capacity & overload protection" Layer 1.
//!
//! The shared state is assembled in `main.rs` and queried by the handler on
//! each request. No background task — state is pulled lazily so the endpoint
//! reflects real-time conditions.
